# GLOW and WaveletFlow

This repo contains the GLOW and WaveletFlow Normalizing Flows.
Glow has been implemented but there is still development undergoing to port the original TensorFlow WaveletFlow code to PyTorch.

To run GLOW, run train_glow.py in the models ditectory. You can edit parameters in the general parameters.py file that share parameters between GLOW and WaveletFlow as well as the parameters.py file in the models' sub directory. Inference.py is specifically for trained models of GLOW. Don't hesitate to contact me if anything is unclear since I did not intend to publicize this repo.
